What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

 - I was struggling with the actual workflow process of Git, especially when combined with GitHub. The terms like "push", "pull", "merge", "fork", etc. were hard to keep straight, and it was hard to remember in which order we needed to do things.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

 - The workflow was clarified a lot. Additionally, merge conflicts were clarified for both of us from Release 5. When I read about merge conflicts last week, I had a tough time wrapping my mind around them, but seeing the simple small conflict in person and doing the steps to resolve it made them much clearer.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

 - I asked my pair for help with syntax and terminal commands that I couldn't remember and for help with steps in the GitHub workflow. We also each asked each other what we thought about processes we were about to do, commit messages we were typing, and other steps along the way. I tried to not directly ask the guide questions and try to Google answers, but when she could tell that we were confused, she stepped in with helpful tips, such as a great website resource for adding picture links in markdown.

What still confuses you about Git?

 - While the workflow has been greatly clarified, picturing it on a multiple-person team, with multiple feature branches being worked on and multiple pull requests coming in, is still tough to imagine.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

 - It was a great first experience! We both grew more comfortable as the session went on, and the flow of the conversation and working on problems became smooth as we worked. I think we completed all of the releases very thoroughly and at a good pace.
