What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
- Remembering the exact syntax and order of the steps was the most challenging.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
- That the order is Add, Commit, Push, Pull and Merge. Guide mentioned that fetch and merge is the same thing as pull but broken into two different steps. The flow on how two people would be using Git to interface with Github became more clear as we saw each others’ screens in real time.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
- What the right syntax for some of the commands such as clone (git clone [URL]) after I typed in git clone branch at first. Checked with Tony if the note for the commits felt right.

What still confuses you about Git? How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
- At this point I feel I still have a lot of git commands to learn and memorise. I’m looking forward to better understanding the robust capabilities of Git.
- First experience pairing in a GPS was great. Tony helped me with the syntax, caught things if I missed anything, and explained well. We both looked things up if we weren’t sure both before and during the GPS.
